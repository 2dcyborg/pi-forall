Pi-Forall language
------------------

This repo contains several versions of a demo implementation of dependently-typed lambda calculus. 

There are three partial versions:

    version1/
    version2/
    version3/
 
Plus one complete version:

    soln/

All of these versions are excerpted from the marked up source files in the directory:

    master/

All edits should be to the code in this directory. The above versions are included in 
the repo just for convenience.
