Pi-Forall language
------------------

This language implemention is designed to accompany four lectures at OPLSS. Notes for these lectures are available at:

[notes.md](notes.md)
[notes2.md](notes2.md)
[notes3.md](notes3.md)
[notes4.md](notes4.md)

This repo contains several versions of a demo implementation of dependently-typed lambda calculus. 

There are three partial versions:

    version1/
    version2/
    version3/
 
Plus one complete version:

    soln/

All of these versions are excerpted from the marked up source files in the directory:

    master/

All edits should be to the code in this directory. The above versions are included in 
the repo just for convenience.
